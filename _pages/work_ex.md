<b> Graduate Researcher </b> - [Information Sciences Institute](https://www.isi.edu/) (*August 2022 - Present*) 

* Designing and teaching agents to play text-based games using deep reinforcement learning and commonsense reasoning.
* Employed a range of language models to determine the optimal next action for the agent within a constrained environment.

<b> Data Scientist </b> - [Housing.com](https://www.housing.com) (*July 2020 - August 2022*) 

* Utilized analytical and technical expertise to deliver insights and suggestions for business progress.
* Developed a fraud engine with **92% precision** that takes historical and session-level attributes to block users from dropping fake leads on the platform and prevent them from exploiting it.
* Formulated and automated a computer vision pipeline that creates a 3D floor plan using multiple equirectangular images, **saving 400 hours** of manual work per month.
* Downsized the manual effort by more than 90% by automating the auditing process of accepting/rejecting images uploaded on the platform, which resulted in operational savings of **USD 40,000/year** and a **12%** increment in online traffic.
* Fully automated the labeling of images into real-estate tags (bedroom, kitchen, etc.) by devising a real-estate image classifier with **93% precision** and **89% recall** using CNN. The model offers **6 FPS** on CPU and works in real-time.

<b> Data Scientist (Intern) </b> - [PropTiger.com](https://www.proptiger.com) (*Jan 2020 - July 2020*)

* Created a pipeline that enhances image quality in terms of contrast, brightness, sharpness, blur, and noise. The pipeline returns an image quality score via statistical analysis, which helped increase the **CTR by 8%** on social media campaigns.
* Developed a service that extracts real-estate entity tags from WhatsApp group messages with **87% f1-score**. The created named entity recognition model uses BERT to extract embeddings, and further, a bi-affine classifier is used for prediction.
